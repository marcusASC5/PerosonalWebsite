      <p class="ratings">
        If you read some of my accomplishments before getting here, you'd find that I referenced something called
        a rating a lot. In Chess, a rating is simply a measure of how strong a person is on the Chess board. 
        The higher your rating is, the better you are at the game. Your rating changes based on how your performance is against 
        your opponents. For example, if I am rated 1400, and I am playing against someone with a rating of 1600, if I won, 
        I would gain more rating points than I would beating someone rated around 1400, and my opponent would lose more 
        rating points than they would if they lost to an opponent near their rating.
        <br>
        Chess players are familiar with a rating system and those rating systems come with titles. Since I am part of the
        United States Chess Federation (USCF), I'll only reference that system, but be mindful that other systems exist, such as FIDE,
        which is used all around the world.
        <br>
        The titles in the USCF are Category 4, Category 3, Category 2, Category 1, Expert, Candidate Master, Master,
        National Master, International Master, and finally, Grandmaster, respectively. As your rating gets higher, you
        can obtain these titles, but some of them, such as International Master, you have to do very specific things in order to 
        qualify.
        <br>
        For a better, more in depth explanation about how ratings work, see this article below.

        <b>My Summary</b>
      </div>
      <p class="summary">
        Chess is a game at the end of the day. Some people will play it more seriously than others. Regardless, it comes with a community,
        willing to help you get better at it, learn a lot more about it than you already do, and also be the hurdles in your way that
        momentarily give you trouble, but end up being a lesson you can reference in the future. Like anything, Chess was life-changing for me,
        and thus, it can be life-changing for everyone. That's why I want to make it available to as many people as I possibly can.
