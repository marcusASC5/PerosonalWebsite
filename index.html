                Who Am I?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Marcus Sutton and I am currently a rising junior in high school.
                I go to Edward R. Murrow High School. I was born, raised, and currently still living in Williamsburg,
                Brooklyn.
                I'm 15 years old, and my birthday is on August 29, 2003.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have three siblings--two sisters and a brother to be specific--and I am the third-born. My mom is
                Jamaican,
                and my dad is African-American, so nothing too special to say about my family history. I, unfortunately,
                did not
                pick up the Patois language from my mother, but I am really good at speaking Italian. My name comes from
                prominent
                Jamaican figure Marcus Garvey.
                <br>
                <br>
                The game of Chess has a very large impact on who I am. I initially did not have any motivation to play
                the game when I first learned.
                It was introduced into my elementary school as a mandatory class, and I, honestly, just saw it as a free
                period in disguise.
                But, I got exponentially good. <em>Incredibly</em> good. I walked into my middle school, one that was
                namely known for its legendary chess team,
                with the little experience I got from elementary school and wound up making some history in my school,
                skyrocketing in only my first year of rated play. Through Chess, I've met a lot of people and made a lot
                of friends.
                It's really changed my outlook on a lot of things, and it has given me a lot of opportunities I may not
                have found without it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ultimately, I want to be able to make my parents proud someday. It doesn't matter what I do, I just want
                them to be able to see me succeed.
                Succession is great for myself, but I also want the people around me to prosper. I lift as many people
                up as I possibly can,
                in hopes of them going on to do great things themselves.

            <p>
                In 5th Grade, my friend, Eve, and I were the top students of the class, side-by-side in basically
                everything,
                and our teacher couldn't decide who deserved to be Valedictorian and Salutatorian.
                I don't remember how he made his decision, but I ended up being Salutatorian.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I said before, I progressed pretty fast in my chess career. In 7th Grade, my rating was over 1900,
                which is really good,
                but before the end of that school year, I went back under 1900. Just before the year officially ended, I
                participated in an annual tournament,
                the Tri-State Chess Championship, held in Bryant Park. I ended up getting a perfect score in the
                tournament, becoming the Tri-State Chess Championship Champion,
                and broke 1900 again, this time soaring above the rest of my non-graduating peers on my chess team,
                which felt amazing in itself, but it wasn't the end to this story.
                Our school had a woman, Miwa McCormick, doing a news report on the excellent chess team we had. She
                originally was going to focus on a girl on our chess team,
                but she shifted the focus slightly, but not completely, onto me when she witnessed how good I was
                firsthand,
                as she was at the park with my coach for this tournament in particular. She came to my home and
                interviewed me,
                and took some footage of me studying, as well as with my family. Thanks to her, I ended up on Japanese
                television!
                <br>
                <br>
                My next accomplishment was a direct result of the last one. In 8th Grade, the World Chess Championship
                of 2016 was occurring in NYC,
                so the world champion of Chess, Magnus Carlsen was coming to New York and it was an opportunity my
                school seized immediately.
                We got him to come to our school and he was set to play games against three players on the Chess team. I
                got to play against him,
                mostly because of my impressive excellence in the game as a whole, and because, at the time, I was the
                highest rated person on the entire chess team.
                It was an incredible, and, most importantly, different experience. I expected Magnus to be this bigshot
                guy, as he was the world champion,
                but he was really nice and down to Earth. Great guy, and he played a great game. I mean, he destroyed
                me, but it was such an honor to be destroyed by <em>him</em>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This accomplishment will slightly throw off the order I have created here, but it is that I became a member
                of the National Junior Honor Society in 8th Grade and then the National Honor Society in 10th Grade. This is big for
                me because I work hard every day and these are both pay-offs of working so hard. These were two validations
                of my promise to put my education above everything so that I could succeed. If you are unfamiliar with the Honor Societies,
                basically you had to have consistent good grades, 90+ to be specific. There are a few more requirements, most of them actually
                only falling into the National Honor Society from what I remember, but the grades were the biggest, common thing.
                <br>
                <br>
                It's important that you know that although I made quick history on my Chess team in middle school, that I was even leading
                at one point, towards the end of 8th Grade, I fell into a terrible slump. In 8th Grade, I peaked at a rating of 1961,
                just 39 points from being officially titled an expert in the game, but over time, my rating fell, and fell, and fell, and fell...
                I left the school I made a massive imprint on with a rating of 1792, which, personally, was embarrassing, because I was only imagining
                breaking 2000 before leaving the school that made me such a beast on the Chess board.
