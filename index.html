          Who Am I?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          My name is Marcus Sutton and I am currently a junior at Edward R. Murrow High School.
          I was born, raised, and currently still living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I'm 16 years
          old, and my birthday is on August 29, 2003.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have three siblings--two sisters and a brother to be specific--and I
          am the third-born. My mom is Jamaican, and my dad is African-American,
          so nothing too special to say about my family history. I,
          unfortunately, did not pick up the Patois language from my mother, but
          I am really good at speaking Italian. My name comes from prominent
          Jamaican figure Marcus Garvey.
          <br />
          <br />
          The game of Chess has a very large impact on who I am. I initially did
          not have any motivation to play the game when I first learned, but over
          time I grew to love it and became good. <i>Incredibly</i> good. Through Chess,
          I've met a lot of people and made a lot of friends. It's really
          changed my outlook on a lot of things, and it has given me a lot of
          opportunities I may not have found without it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ultimately, I want to be able to make my parents proud someday. It
          doesn't matter what I do, I just want them to be able to see me
          succeed. Also, while succession for myself is great, I also want the people
          around me to prosper. I lift as many people up as I possibly can, in
          hopes of them going on to do great things themselves.

          Awards & Accomplishments

        <br />
        <p>
          As I said before, I progressed pretty fast in my chess career. In 7th
          Grade, my rating was over 1900--which is really good--but before the
          end of that school year, I went back under 1900. However, I played in a
          tournament at Bryant Park in that very same school year and somehow
          I ended up on Japanese television! More about this on my Chess webpage.
          <br />
          <br />
          This accomplishment will slightly throw off the order I have created
          here, but it is that I became a member of the National Junior Honor
          Society in 8th Grade and then the National Honor Society in 10th
          Grade. This is big for me because I work hard every day and these are
          both pay-offs of working so hard. They validated my
          promise to put my education above everything so that I could succeed.          
          <br />
          <br />
          My next accomplishment was Co-Hosting the A Better World Festival, a
          festival my community service organization hosts, bringing together a ton of
          nonprofit organizations who serve the youth of this and the next
          generation and can impact their lives for the better, so that they can
          help create a better world. More about this on my Story webpage.
          <br />
          <br />
          My next accomplishment was showcasing my project at Google's Holiday Showcase.
          I got into Google's Code Next program in October and since then, I learned how
          to code in the Python language, and simultaneously make music through this program
          called EarSketch. I've made a few songs with the program, which my coaches thought were
          awesome, and it motivated me to show it off at the annual showcase Google has.
          It was an awesome experience because I made some really good music, according to my listeners,
          in just a few months of learning. It was so good that it motivated some of the other students in the
          program to join the club I was in to learn how to make music when they get a chance. That really made
          the experience feel awesome and wholesome for that matter.
          <br>
          <br>
          My next accomplishment was breaking expert in chess! I have been playing chess for 7 years now, competitively for 5 years,
          and all of the hard work I've committed to it has paid off. I'm not stopping any time soon, but I am so proud of myself for
          persevering and making it to expert. It only means becoming a master is the next step though!
          <br>
          <br>
          This accomplishment is sort of a work-in-progress as well as a complete piece of work; I've been learning piano since
          the beginning of this school year and, not only have I progressed speedily at learning how to play, but I have also
          written two songs on the piano myself and I'm very proud of them. They show both my abilities up to their creation, as
          well as my potential to grow much more. There are new songs coming soon!
